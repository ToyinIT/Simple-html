    <h1>Links</h1>
    <P>This example is about links and <a a href='images.html'>images</a></P>
    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute links, like to
            <a href='https://google.com/'> Google Chrome</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.
        </li>
        <li> Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html"> extras page</a></li
    <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may also be Interested in <a href="links.html"</p>
        <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href="/">home page </a> of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now. Unfortunately, there is no caveat to our discussion o Root-relative links: this entire tutorial uses local HTML files instead of a website hosted on a web server. This means we won't be able to experiment with Root-relative links. But, if we did have a real server, the link to our homepage would look like proper</html></li>
